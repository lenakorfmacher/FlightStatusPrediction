While it would be interesting to find out, whether or not a flight disruption is connected to an individual airplane, I think that for prediction, this feature might introduce bias or overfitting. In addition to that, there seem to be other factors in air traffic which have a much greater impact on whether a flight is disrupted or not, such as weather and airport logistics. As there are high safety standards in air traffic in general, technical disruptions within an individual machine seem to be rather extraordinary events without a reasonable pattern we can identify in combination with the other features in our dataset.\n",

We see that JetBlue Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, etc. all have different connections with flight number \"3\". For every airline, however, the connection for flight number \"3\" is always the same, e.g. for Hawaiian Airlines, this is the connection Los Angeles - Honolulu. Therefore, if we want to uniquely identify a flight by its connection and the specific airline, we would have to merge the flight number an airline."
